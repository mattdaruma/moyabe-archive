When I first began patrolling in Trussville, I fell in love with the Sherman Oaks subdivision. It has a beautiful entrance, it's centrally located and has direct access to the Sports Complex with parks and trails. The houses are all beautiful and the streets are quiet. I had the privilege to sell one recently and the new owners love the neighborhood as much as I do!"
